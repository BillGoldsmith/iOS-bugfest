## Brief description of the issue:
I was attempting to make a peanut butter sandwich.  After applying the peanut butter to the bread, the kitchen unexpectedly inverted.

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Locate the bread bag.
2. Open the bread bag and extract two slices onto the countertop.
3. Close the bread bag and put it away.
4. Locate the cupboard containing the jar of peanut butter.
5. Open the cupboard and move the jar to the counter.
6. Grasp the jar with one hand; with the other hand, twist the lid counter-clockwise to remove and set aside.
8. Open the utensil drawer and withdraw a non-serrated knife.
9. Dip the knife into the jar and swirl around to gather about 1 tablespoon of peanut butter.
10. Slather the peanut butter evenly on one slice of bread...

### Expected result:
I was trying to make a peanut butter sandwich.

### Actual result:
The sandwich ended up on the ceiling, and the dog is eating out of the jar.
